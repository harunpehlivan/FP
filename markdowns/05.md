# Thinking Functionally, the mindset game. 

## So, How can I use it?

### Avoid for loops or while statements
* A loop is an imperative control structure that is hard to reuse and difficult to plug in to other operations. We can use Recursion instead

### What should use instead

### Avoid long functions

### Avoid exceptions thrown

### Avoid if-then-else statements



```javascript runnable
var a = 2;
var b = 4;
console.log(a+b);
```
