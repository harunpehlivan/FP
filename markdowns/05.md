# Thinking Functionally, the mindset game. 

## So, How can I use it?


## Avoid for loops or while statements
* Why remove loops from your code? A loop is an imperative control?
* A loop is an imperative control structure thatâ€™s hard to reuse and difficult to plug in to other operations. 

### What should use instead?
* We can use Recursion instead for or while loops
* 

```javascript runnable
var a = 2;
var b = 4;
console.log(a+b);
```

## Avoid if-then-else statements
