# Currying
Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into **evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument**.

This becomes very easy using lambda functions and closures. Let's dive straight into code:

@[Get the even numbers in an array]({ "stubs": ["currying/example1.js"], "command": "node currying/example1.js" })

So why is this useful? Because we are now able to pass the arguments at **different points in time**; this means that we can use currying to "construct" a function.

E.g.
@[Generic filter callback to check any property of an object]({ "stubs": ["currying/example2.js"], "command": "node currying/example2.js" })

And now, time to get your hands dirty: remember the `applyCoupon` function we wrote in the previous chapter? It was very specific; now we want to create a curryable function that takes as arguments (in this order) category, discount between 0 and 1 (a 2$ item with a 0.1 discount will cost 1.8$) and an item, and that returns the item with the correct price.  
E.g.
```js
const item = {
           "name": "Biscuits",
           "type": "regular",
           "category": "food",
           "price": 2.0
         }
         
applyCoupon("food")(0.1)(item).price === 1.8
```
Remember to apply the discount only to the right items!
